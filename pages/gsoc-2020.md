## Google Summer of Code 2020 Work Product Submission
_August 31, 2020_

#### Student
Simon Pelletier

#### Organization
[INCF](https://www.incf.org/) -- International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility

#### Project Title
Improve [LORIS](http://loris.ca/) API development and documentation

#### Mentors
Christine Rogers, Xavier Lecours-Boucher

### Project Proposal 
1) Improvement of existing API endpoints and solving priority issues for API infrastructure <br/>
2) Develop new workflow templates <br/>
3) Creating new endpoints for modules of Loris <br/>
4) Writing the documentation <br/>
5) Provide comprehensive tutorials in Jupyter notebooks as examples of how to use the API new endpoints

### EXTRA
Developping a whole new integration tests suite for the API was not planned in the proposed project for the summer. The propoal included writing tests for the endpoints I would create, but it was not mentionned in the proposal I would be writing the whole integration test suite, even for the more than 60 already existing endpoints, with all the difficulties that come with starting the test suite. The plan was to write the tests immediatly when I create new endpoints, which after creating the integration test suite will be quite easy. What has taken a very long time was not in the writing of the tests themselves, but how to connect to the API successfully using the scripts for testing that already exist. Still, it has been an enriching experience, but this extra work turned out to be one of my main contribution for the summer.
