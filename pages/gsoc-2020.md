## Google Summer of Code 2020 Work Product Submission
_August 31, 2020_

#### Student
Simon Pelletier

#### Organization
[INCF](https://www.incf.org/) -- International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility

#### Project Title
Improve [LORIS](http://loris.ca/) API development and documentation 

#### Mentors
Christine Rogers, Xavier Lecours-Boucher

### Project Proposal 
- Improvement of existing API endpoints and solving priority issues for API infrastructure <br/>
- Develop new workflow templates <br/>
- Creating new endpoints for modules of Loris <br/>
- Writing the documentation <br/>
- Provide comprehensive tutorials in Jupyter notebooks as examples of how to use the API new endpoints <br/>

### Project Overview

Loris uses a LAMP structure (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP), so the endpoints use HTTP requests to communicate to the 
database. The API makes data acquisition from a scripting language, such as Python or R, easy and secure. It is an 
invaluable tool to develop workflows that can be easily and rapidly be deployed. 

During the summer, I improved the API by fixing bugs and writing an integration test suite that ensures future 
modifications of the codebase do not cause problems down the line in the API. The integration tests are run every 
time new code is pushed on a branch of Loris using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), so it will prevent bugs to 
manifest by blocking any modifications that breaks the API. Given the size and complexity of the Loris codebase, a bug 
that goes unnoticed can be long to fix and slow down future developments. This problem would undoubtedly grow as the 
codebase grows, thus the importance of writing integration tests early. These automatic tests will obviously help for
testing the code during the code review process, as some tests can be time consuming, especially when they have to be 
repeated often when debugging.

In addition to improving the API, I wrote documentation in the form of Jupyter notebooks with examples 
on how to use each endpoint of the API with python. I also developed work flow tutorials in the form of Jupyter 
notebooks. These tutorials demonstrate how to use the API's endpoints to download all images and electrophysiology 
recordings contained in a project, then pre-process the samples for subsequent analysis. The purpose of these
notebooks is not to create additional modules to analyse the data or make an exhaustive list of possible subsequent 
analysis, but it is usually very helpful as a starting point for the users and mights how useful LORIS could be if
used as part of neuroinformatics workflows. 

### Summer Timeline
#### May
The first month was spent installing Loris on my own Virtual Machine. I also spent time learning new skills (e.g. how to use the text editor Vim), getting to know the codebase of Loris and the team of developers.

#### June
##### Integration tests
In June, I started with to write a brand new test suite for LORIS REST API endpoints.

##### New endpoints
I started writing a new endpoint to download all DICOM files available in a project.

#### July

##### Integration tests
Most of the work was done by the end of july, but it was merged on August 27th, mostly because of reasons related to the 
creation of a new integration test suite. More work needs to be done to cover all of the current endpoints, but testing 
of the API will now be more efficient and will make the development of new endpoints faster and safer not to break 
existing endpoints.  

##### Jupyter notebooks
I started working on the notebooks 
- The first notebook contains basic examples on how to use each endpoints.
- The second notebook contains an example of a workflow to pre-process all the images downloaded with the API for
subsequent analysis by the researchers using Loris.

##### New endpoints
I continued the work started in June and started writing PUT and PATCH methods that were missing in one of the existing 
endpoints.

##### August
August was mostly dedicated to make sure all the work started in the previous months are finished and that
most Pull Requests be merged by August 31st, or as close as possible to be merged. 

##### What will happen to open PRs?

Open GSOC PRs should be merged over the next few weeks.

### Summer project presentation (August 18th)

On August 18th, I presented the work I have done on the API during my Google Summer of Code.
